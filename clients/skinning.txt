Use KSITheme.zip uncompressed as a starting point for a sencha architect theme.
In Sencha Architected -> Project Explorere (in the right hand pane) select the neptune them under 'Resources'
The only thing you should need to change is the base color for component.  But you may need to change other stuff.
Then select 'Build web app'.
It will generate a weird css file. Something like: ./theme/ext-theme-neptune-7eb360ee-e64f-4c01-a112-e02917b024e0.css
scp ./theme/ext-theme-neptune-7eb360ee-e64f-4c01-a112-e02917b024e0.css quickmit.net:/usr/www/users/d4dl/quickmit.net/clients/{CLIENT_DIR}/build/production/MyApp/resources/MyApp-all.css
